            Ample warning ahead, I'm discussing spoilers for both movie and novel. If you haven't seen the movie, please do yourself a favour and go see it.
            Denis Villeneuve is doing what Peter Jackson did twenty years ago.

        I'm an atheist, and if card carrying was still a thing, I would most likely have one. But there is something intimately fascinating
        about religion. The kind of fascinating built upon ideals of romantiscm and a general love for storytelling. I am a firm believer that
        the Bible is at a minimum, the greatest story ever told.

        If you've either read or seen Dune (Part 2), you can start to see where I'm going with this I think. Religion is undoubtedly one of the corner stones
        of the story. The Bene Gesserit and their role in "constructing" the Kwisatz-Haderach, and how they take their story around the world, is 
        a significant story point for Paul. A millenia of eugenics and weird space drugs has lead to humanities greatest...

        Paul as a character is an interesting one. I'm jumping the gun here a bit, but Herbert famously disliked peoples reaction to Paul's character 
        in the novel, and set out to correct his mistake in 'Dune: Messaih'. However, I think Villeneuve has managed to nail his stark aspects. The use
        of Chani (and Zendaya's excellent portrayel) as our perspective is making a strong case for his apparent derangment.

        I have a friend who just finished the first novel. He made a comment to me, that I personally can't attest to but I think is interesting, in that
        Paul just seems to go crazy at some point, and he can't quite pinpoint when. I think the craziness is a bit better telegraphed in the movie, but
        pointing to an exact moment is not really possible. You might motion his rebirth, but that only happened after he'd already commited to his
        decision to head south. He only decided to head south after he had a vision of Chani being irradiated by his nuclear weapons. That point isn't
        solid either because he only pushes on after Chani reaffirms her commitment to him. The movie has built up a sequence of events where any and all
        are the beginning of Paul's end.

        The only definitive point, to me at least, is Paul's conversation with Jessica after he has drunk the 'Water of Life'. High on melange, he stretches 
        and gestures to a narrow way forward. The later Frank novel readers know the name of this way, but I hold the idea that Paul and Leto's paths
        are not quite the same thing.

        Messaihenic figures have a tendency to hold steadfast on their own beliefs, build a bridge to an endpoint and leave it at that. The after is 
        someone else's role and responsibility. Dune's 'Presience' is also built on the idea of doing so much math in your head, you can predict the future.
        This is both a murky idea, and not one I agree with. Humans are famously non-deterministic, arbitary decisions being sprung forward for God knows
        where...
    </p>

    <p>
        Engaging with Dune and that arbitary notion in mind...
        Left with a (high) madman in charge, his two next-greatest sources of advice, Stilgar and Gurney, both feeding his fire. His greatest source
        fleeing deep into valleys unknown. The literal galaxy holds its breath waiting for a decision we already know the answer to.

        <p>I have a few hundred more thoughts about this move, so I'll likely be coming back later.</p>
